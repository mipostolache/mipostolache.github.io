I am from Romania, but have been studying in the UK since Year 12, when I received an [HMC scholarship](https://www.hmc.org.uk/about-us/hmc-projects/student-scholarships/) at the [Royal Masonic School for Girls](https://www.rmsforgirls.com/) in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.

I am now a Part III student in the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge. My college is [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/).

In my time outside of maths, I dedicate most of my free time to scouting (see [CUSAGC](https://cusagc.soc.srcf.net/)).
