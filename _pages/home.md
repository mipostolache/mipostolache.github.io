### Hello and welcome!

I am Mara (she/her), a first-year PhD student at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/). My supervisors are [Huy The Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/mathnguyenthehuy/home) and [Shengwen Wang](http://shengwen-wang.net/). 

My research interests are in geometric analysis, in particular related to mean curvature flow and minimal surfaces. Recently, I have been focusing on the study of translating solitons of the mean curvature flow.

Before I started my PhD, I did my undergraduate and integrated master's at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/).
