I am from Romania, but have been studying in the UK since Year 12, when I received an HMC scholarship at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.

I am now a Part II student in the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge. My college is Peterhouse.

In my time outside of maths, I dedicate most of my free time to scouting (see [CUSAGC](https://cusagc.soc.srcf.net/)).
