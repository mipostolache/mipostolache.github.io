## Talks
1. **The X-Ray Transform and Geometric Inverse Problems** _(Archimedeans, June 2024)_ - slides [here](../files/maths/talks/M%20Postolache%20-%20The%20X-Ray%20Transform%20and%20Geometric%20Inverse%20Problems.pdf)
## Summer Projects
1. **"Infinite-dimensional geometry of diffusions"** _(summer 2024)_ with [Prof Cl√©ment Mouhot](https://cmouhot.wordpress.com/). Based on [this](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1081/PDE-100002243?needAccess=true) paper.
2. **"Polynomials with many rational preperiodic points"** _(summer 2023)_ with [Prof Holly Krieger](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~hk439/), Aaron Kim, and Vivian Szeto. Slides summarising the progress on the project can be found [here](../files/maths/projects/Polynomials%20With%20Many%20Rational%20Preperiodic%20Points%20-%20CMP%20Presentation.pptx).
